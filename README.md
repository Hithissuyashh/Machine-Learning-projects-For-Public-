# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of real-world, end-to-end Machine Learning projects.  
Each project showcases a full ML workflow including:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection & Training
- Evaluation Metrics
- Exporting the trained model using `pickle` (`model.pkl`)
- Google Colab Notebook (ipynb)
